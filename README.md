# Intermittent FlatList Rendering Failure in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native intermittently fails to render data correctly. The data fetching is working fine, but the rendering process is inconsistent, leading to a blank screen or incomplete item display.  This seems to be particularly problematic on lower-end devices or under less-than-ideal network conditions.

## Bug Description

A FlatList component in a React Native application occasionally fails to render the fetched data. The data is successfully fetched, confirmed through console logs, but the UI does not reflect this. The issue is seemingly random and may be related to performance constraints or race conditions.

## Solution

The proposed solution involves using `getItemLayout` prop in FlatList to optimize rendering performance, and introducing error handling to improve the robustness of the component.
